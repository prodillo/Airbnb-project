# Airbnb-project

In this project we will explore an LA Airbnb dataset (that can be found in: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) to try to understand what features drive revenue in the Airbnb rental business. Ultimately, our goal is to find what makes a listing successful and to help Aibnb hosts with useful insights.
