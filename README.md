# Airbnb-project

Airbnb is a global platform helping travelers to find home rentals and experiences all across the globe. Airbnb encourages hosts to post their listings for rental business and guests to book their stay. 

Here, for this project, we will explore LA Airbnb dataset to understand what features drive revenue in the Airbnb rental business. Ultimately, our goal is to find what makes a listing successful and to help Aibnb hosts with useful insights.
